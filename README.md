# Let's ML - Learning Machine Learning, One Step at a time

This repo is for our machine learning meetings in which we hope to cover new topics each week to better understand certain aspects of machine learing practice and application.

The data we use is from the Kaggle Titanic challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

## Week 1: Baseline
In week 1 we lay out a high level program for doing the bare minimum needed for machine learning. the steps are laid out and a very first program is made which reads data, feeds it to a model and produces some results.

We also follow up with a simple improvement using feature engineering.

## Week 2: Data Processing
In Week 2 we take a look at some data processing tasks one can do to better understand and interpret their data.


## More to come!...
